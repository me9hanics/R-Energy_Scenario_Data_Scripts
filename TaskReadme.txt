Dear Candidate,

In this folder you find several R scripts, and some scenario data.

As a first step, please complete the code in RUNSCRIPT.R.
Your task is to write a few* lines of code that create the output similar to what is in `Data/EXAMPLE EXPECTED OUTPUT`.

After that, your task is to set up some code tests. 
Please try to write at least one test (e.g. unit test, performance test, or smoke test).
It does not have to be perfect, but be prepared to walk us through your thinking during the interview.

That's all we need for you to come to the interview prepared.
However, you're more than welcome to provide more than one test, or show off your Git/GitHub skills by creating a repository or even setting up a CI/CD workflow.






* this should be less than 20 lines
